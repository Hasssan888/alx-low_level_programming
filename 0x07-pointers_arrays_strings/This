sage suggests a few options for dealing with the situation:

(O)pen Read-Only: Open the file in read-only mode, allowing you to view its contents without making any changes.
(E)dit anyway: Open the file for editing, despite the presence of the swap file. This option should be chosen with caution, as it may result in conflicts if another program is already editing the same file.
(R)ecover: Attempt to recover any changes made to the file from the swap file. You can use the command ":recover" or "vim -r 7-print_chessboard.c" to initiate the recovery process.
(D)elete it: Delete the swap file ".7-print_chessboard.c.swp" to avoid the warning message. This option is appropriate if you don't need to recover any changes.
(Q)uit: Quit the process without taking any action.
(A)bort: Abort the process and exit without taking any action.
You can choose th:wq:wqopriate option based on your requirements.
